						<p>
							Since early 2022 I've been the Creative Content Engineer at
							<a
								href="https://www.knowbe4.com/"
								target="_blank"
								>KnowBe4</a
							>, a security awareness training platform that helps organizations
							train their employees to recognize and avoid cybersecurity
							threats. My role is to create fake phishing emails based on
							real-world attacks that are sent to employees to test if they will
							fall for these simulated attacks. I am also the developer and
							administrator for KnowBe4's
							<a
								href="https://support.knowbe4.com"
								target="_blank"
								>Knowledge Base</a
							>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Prior to that I served as the executive director of the non-profit
							<a
								href="https://www.bikeflorida.org"
								target="_blank"
								>Bike Florida</a
							>, where I worked with state and local governmental agencies to
							promote bicycle safety awareness through tourism.
						</p>

							In my free time you'll find me either reading, playing
							<a

								target="_blank"
								>my all-time favorite video game</a
							>, dabbling in photography, discovering the world, or spoiling my
							German Shepherd Petra.
